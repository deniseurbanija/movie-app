        <p>
          This is a movie application using technologies such as AJAX, Node.js,
          Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, and Bootstrap. The application displays
          movies through cards, allowing users to add and remove movies from a
          REST API. With an intuitive interface, users can explore details of
          each movie and efficiently manage their collection. Thanks to AJAX,
          the application offers a real-time interactive experience, while
          Node.js and Express handle server requests and logic. MongoDB and
          Mongoose are responsible for storing and manipulating data
          efficiently, while Bootstrap ensures a responsive and appealing design
          across different devices.
